ZodiacPress cities.txt Builder
==============================

This is a toolkit to build the `cities.txt` data file (which is available [here](https://download.cosmicplugins.com/)). The `cities.txt` file is created from data that is taken from GeoNames.org export files, and modifed/optimized for use with ZodiacPress.
